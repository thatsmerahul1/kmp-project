# ADR-0001: Kotlin Multiplatform Selection

## Status
**Accepted** - 2024-12-29

## Context
We need to create a template project that demonstrates modern cross-platform mobile development with maximum code sharing between Android and iOS platforms while maintaining native performance and user experience.

## Decision
We have decided to use **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** for the shared business logic and platform-specific UI frameworks.

### Technology Stack:
- **Shared Logic**: Kotlin Multiplatform
- **Android UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **iOS UI**: SwiftUI
- **Target Code Sharing**: 70-85% business logic

## Rationale

### Advantages of KMP:
1. **High Code Sharing**: 70-85% of business logic can be shared
2. **Native Performance**: Compiles to native code on both platforms
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Can be introduced incrementally
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with Kotlin's type system
5. **Mature Ecosystem**: Well-established libraries (Ktor, SQLDelight, Coroutines)
6. **Platform Native UI**: Allows platform-specific UI for optimal UX

### Alternatives Considered:

#### Flutter
- **Pros**: Single codebase, fast development, good performance
- **Cons**: Different tech stack, custom UI widgets, learning curve for native developers
- **Verdict**: Rejected - Team prefers native UI experience

#### React Native
- **Pros**: JavaScript ecosystem, code sharing, mature framework
- **Cons**: Performance limitations, bridge architecture overhead, maintenance complexity
- **Verdict**: Rejected - Performance and maintenance concerns

#### Native Development
- **Pros**: Maximum performance, platform-optimized UX, full platform APIs
- **Cons**: Duplicate business logic, increased maintenance, slower feature delivery
- **Verdict**: Rejected - High development and maintenance costs

## Consequences

### Positive:
- High code reuse in business logic layer
- Native performance and UX on both platforms
- Leverages existing Android team's Kotlin expertise
- Strong tooling support from JetBrains and Google
- Active community and continuous improvements

### Negative:
- iOS team needs to learn Kotlin interop patterns
- Additional build complexity for iOS
- Some learning curve for iOS-specific KMP patterns
- Platform-specific code still required for UI layers

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- iOS integration helpers and wrappers
- Team training on KMP best practices
- Clear separation of shared vs platform-specific code

## Implementation Notes
- Shared module contains: domain models, business logic, data layer, networking
- Platform modules contain: UI, platform-specific APIs, dependency injection setup
- Use expect/actual for platform-specific implementations
- Maintain clean architecture boundaries between layers
