# WeatherKMP Shared Module API Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive API reference for the WeatherKMP shared module, following 2025 KMP standards.

## Module Overview

The WeatherKMP shared module implements a clean architecture pattern with modern Kotlin Multiplatform features:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic with Result pattern and domain-driven error handling
- **Data Layer**: Repository pattern with local/remote data sources and robust caching
- **Presentation Layer**: Platform-abstracted UI components and ViewModels with state management
- **UI Enhancement Layer**: 2025 UI/UX features including adaptive layouts, dynamic theming, accessibility, and haptic feedback

## Architecture Highlights

### Modern KMP Features (2025)
- **Result<T> Wrapper Pattern**: Type-safe error handling across all layers
- **Base Classes**: Standardized BaseUseCase, BaseRepository, BaseViewModel patterns
- **Flow Operators**: Advanced reactive programming with latest kotlinx.coroutines
- **Platform Abstraction**: UI component abstraction layer for future Compose Multiplatform migration
- **Structured Concurrency**: Proper coroutine scope management and cancellation

### Performance & Quality
- **R8 Optimization**: Full proguard rules with baseline profiles
- **Startup Performance**: Comprehensive app startup tracking and optimization
- **Code Coverage**: 85%+ coverage enforcement with Kover
- **Code Complexity**: Automated complexity analysis and quality gates

### UI/UX Enhancements (2025)
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Foldable device support with form factor detection
- **Dynamic Color**: Material You theming with weather-based colors and accessibility compliance
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance with screen reader support
- **Shared Element Transitions**: Material Motion patterns with weather-specific transitions
- **Haptic Feedback**: Context-aware haptic patterns for weather conditions

## Key Components

### Domain Layer
The domain layer provides the core business logic with clean separation of concerns:
- **Weather**: Primary domain model with comprehensive weather data representation
- **WeatherCondition**: Sealed class hierarchy for type-safe weather state management
- **Result<T>**: Wrapper pattern for error handling without exceptions
- **BaseUseCase**: Standardized use case pattern with Result return types

### Data Layer
The data layer implements a robust repository pattern:
- **WeatherRepository**: Primary repository interface with caching and synchronization
- **WeatherRepositoryImpl**: Implementation with local/remote data source coordination
- **LocalWeatherDataSource**: SQLDelight-based local storage with migration support
- **RemoteWeatherDataSource**: Ktor-based API client with modern serialization

### Presentation Layer
The presentation layer provides platform-abstracted components:
- **BaseViewModel**: Standardized ViewModel base with SavedStateHandle integration
- **WeatherViewModel**: Main weather screen ViewModel with comprehensive state management
- **UIComponent**: Platform abstraction interface for future Compose Multiplatform migration
- **NavigationManager**: Cross-platform navigation with type-safe routing

### UI Enhancement Layer
Advanced UI/UX features following 2025 standards:
- **AdaptiveLayoutManager**: Form factor detection and foldable device support
- **DynamicThemeManager**: Material You implementation with accessibility considerations
- **AccessibilityManager**: Comprehensive accessibility support with WCAG compliance
- **SharedElementTransitionManager**: Material Motion transitions with weather theming
- **HapticFeedbackManager**: Context-aware haptic feedback with weather-specific patterns

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Minimum 85% test coverage enforced via CI/CD
- Complexity analysis with automated quality gates
- Comprehensive error handling with sealed class hierarchies
- Modern Kotlin features including value classes, sealed interfaces, and context receivers

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic with MockK and Turbine
- Integration tests for repository layer with real database
- ViewModel tests with coroutine testing utilities
- Cross-platform test coverage with shared test utilities

### Documentation Standards
- KDoc documentation for all public APIs
- Architecture decision records for major design choices
- Code examples in documentation
- API playground integration for interactive exploration

## Migration Readiness

The shared module is designed for future Compose Multiplatform migration:
- UI abstraction layer provides seamless transition path
